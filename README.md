# Intel<sup>速</sup> Security Libraries for Data Center  - Verification Service
### The Intel<sup>速</sup> SecL - DC Verification Service component performs remote attestation of physical servers, comparing Intel<sup>速</sup> TXT measurements of BIOS, OS, Asset Tag, and other components against a database of known-good values. The attested trust status of each server is used to make policy decisions for workload placement. As a server boots, Intel<sup>速</sup> TXT begins extending measurements to a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Each chain of trust component is measured, and these measurements are remotely verified using the Attestation Server.
